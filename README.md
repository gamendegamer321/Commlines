# CommNet Utils
Adds the CommNet lines from KSP 1 to KSP 2. This will finally allow you to see the CommNet you have set up in KSP 2.

This mod requires [SpaceWarp](https://spacedock.info/mod/3277/Space%20Warp%20+%20BepInEx) 1.4.0+

## How to use
Simply install the mod and whenever you open the map screen, you can see the green lines between vessels that can communicate with each other.
If the green lines become too much, you can enable path mode in the settings, which will only show the path the connection takes from that vessel back to the KSC. (see also the images below for a comparison)

When switching to path mode or back, it might take a few seconds for the lines to update.

## Images
Below I have added a few images of how the lines look. I have added images with pathmode off and images of the same scenario with pathmode on.

### Pathmode = off
